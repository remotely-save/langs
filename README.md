# Translations for Remotely Save

## How To Add A Language?

1. Copy `en.json` to a new json file named `<lang>.json`, and translate all the items inside. The language should match what is available in Obsidian app.
2. Modify the `index.ts` file to include the new language file.

~~## Why Seperated Repo?~~

~~For better pull requests management.~~

## No more `lang` submodule from 20240106

It's actually harder to manage pull requests of submodule for me. The submodule is merged back to the main repo on 20240106. Any further improved translations (and/or pull requestes) should be dealt with in the main repo.
